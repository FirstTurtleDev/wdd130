        <p>Ever since I was young, I’ve been passionate about technology and creativity. My journey into programming began with curiosity and grew into a deep dedication to coding and digital innovation. I have studied programming independently, constantly seeking out new challenges and expanding my skills.

One of my early achievements was participating in LEGO robotics competitions, where I combined engineering, coding, and problem-solving in a fun and competitive environment. That experience fueled my interest in more advanced projects, eventually leading me to earn a certificate in Virtual Reality development using Unity — a milestone that strengthened my skills in immersive digital experiences.

My true passion lies in creating video games. I love building worlds, designing mechanics, and writing the code that brings it all to life. Whether working on prototypes or polished titles, I find joy in every step of the game development process.

In addition to my work in tech, I’m also a music composer. I enjoy blending sound and emotion, often using music to enhance the stories I tell through games or as a standalone creative outlet.

Driven by curiosity, creativity, and a love for learning, I continue to grow as a programmer, game developer, and artist.</p>

        <p>The Dominican Republic is a vibrant Caribbean nation known for its stunning beaches, lush mountains, and rich cultural heritage. Sharing the island of Hispaniola with Haiti, it offers a blend of Spanish colonial history, lively music and dance like merengue and bachata, and warm, welcoming people. From the historic Zona Colonial in Santo Domingo to the turquoise waters of Punta Cana, the country is a popular destination for tourists seeking both relaxation and adventure.</p>
